# ImageCompressor

A small personal utility to explore different image compression strategies from the CLI. The plan:

- Start with a simple PNG/JPEG recompressor using Pillow
- Add a tiny CLI with presets and quality targets
- Add a dry-run report mode showing size deltas
- Add a folder mode with a summary report
- Add a basic test scaffold and a Makefile for routine tasks

This is a solo, nights-and-weekends learning project. No guarantees; just hacking and notes.
